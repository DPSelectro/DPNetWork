# DPNetwork

This repositorys stores code for the DPNetwork project. DPNetwork detects malicous network flows using Joy and the UNSW and USTC datasets. By anlyzing bidirectional network flow statistics, DPNetwork enables  The DPNetwork incorporates differential privacy through an prepended autoencoder. By then making use of the bounded output stablility property of differential privacy, this project enables robust detection of malicious flows and protects agains carefully designed adversarial example attacks.
